# Security-Tools

Repository for a bash script I made to autonomize the installation of essential network tools for any new NetSec person. This is ideally made for George Mason's Patriot Hackers group

<code>chmod +x ./netSecTools_install.sh</code></br>
<h2>Supported Package managers</h2>
<ul>

<p>Want more support? make a ticket with the package manager request and preferrably the path of it on your distro.</p>
